# Puzzle Alarm App for macOS

The Puzzle Alarm app, crafted with SwiftUI for macOS, is more than just an alarm. It incorporates a memory game to ensure that you're fully awake before you can turn off the alarm. This approach adds a layer of engagement to your morning routine, aiming to make waking up a bit more interesting.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Alarm Time:** Set your alarm effortlessly with a user-friendly interface.
- **Interactive Memory Game:** To turn off the alarm, solve a memory game that guarantees you're alert.
- **Persistent Application State:** The app requires the memory game to be completed before it can be closed or quit, ensuring you're ready to start your day.
- **Forced Volume Control:** If the volume is lowered or muted, the app intervenes by raising the system volume to ensure the alarm is heard.
- **Gradual Volume Increase:** Begins with a softer volume that gently rises, designed to wake you up without a start.
- **Snooze Option:** A snooze feature for those mornings when you need just a bit more sleep.
